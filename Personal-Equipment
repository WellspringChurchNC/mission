### The “latest” on IEM options … as of April 2018 …
#### Some “history” / chronology
When we first started … many team members were on a budget and hesitant to spend $ on equipment.  The reality is that singers and instrumentalists need “good” IEMs in order to block out “stage” noise and hear themselves effectively.  To that end, we recommended an original set of IEM choices geared towards the best known info at that time (mid-2015).  Since then, tech continues to improve and there are more really good choices than ever before.  For the budget / cost constrained performer I still suggest the JVCs and regardless of the IEM selected **I always highly recommend custom fit molds** (either DIY or done by an audiologist/IEM provider).  Note that if you use the JVCs, MEEs or KZs you can create DIY molds that provide very good sound isolation for about $10.
#### The “latest” recommendations ...
_KZ ZST IEMs are Jim's "best value" recommendation._

| More expensive Westone and Shure | $200-$900 | Usually more drivers | Not worth it (IMO) | Sweetwater |
| JLA Custom IEMs<br>Grace 8 | $400+ | Quad Driver | Not worth it (IMO) unless playing “often” | https://www.facebook.com/JLA-Custom-in-Ear-monitors-2206326206260955 |

#### The original, mid 2015 post on IEMs …
Possible IEMs and personal amps (instead of Avioms) for everyone's use:
- $12 to $30 JVC HA-FX1X In-Ear Headphones
- $45 Brainwavz ProAlpha In-Ear Headphones http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JHVJ5A/
- $150 to $400 Westone UM 10, 20, or 30
- for singers or instrumentalists:  $45 Rolls PM50S Personal Monitor Amp  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00J14G7OO/
- for instrumentalists that also sing:  $76 Rolls PM351 Personal Monitor Station http://www.amazon.com/rolls-PM351-Personal-Monitor-Station/dp/B001032IDS/
Everyone has their own opinion on what constitutes "best" ... since we're not professionals, I tend to lean more towards "value" (ie mix of price & performance) than "best gear for top dollar" so I did some research and found a range of options from this site:  http://www.headphonesunboxed.com/best-in-ear-monitors/
- Recently found some pretty strong reviews about the bass response on the JVC HA-FX1X headphones ... I'm finding these on ebay as low as $12 and as high as $30 on Amazon.  Here's some spec comparisons to help with making a decision:

| Spec | [JVC HA-FX1X](http://support.jvc.com/consumer/product.jsp?modelId=MODL028895&pathId=162&page=3&archive=true) | [Westone UM 10](http://www.westoneaudio.com/index.php/products/um-series/um-pro-10.html) | [Brainwavz ProAlpha](http://www.yourbrainwavz.com/proalpha.html) |

### IEM Mixing Hints and Tips
All of the comments here, talk about mixing from a personal mixer perspective ... in our case the Avioms (not the main sound board).  The content below was extracted / gleaned from articles and should be used as input / additional education but may not be 100% factual.
#### Best Practices
So now that you have your system, what are some things you can do to make each mix as good and helpful as possible?
Here are some thing to think about when training users:
- **Make sure the master volume is at unity or “0”**; If you crank the individual instruments but have the master volume down, you will cause distortion and discomfort.
- **Try and keep the main EQ as flat as possible**; Like mixing for the PA, EQ should be in small doses.
- **Pan instruments and vocals to create space**; While in a large venue mono may be desirable to make sure everyone hears the same mix, it tends to clutter up an in-ear mix. Use panning to keep things in special perspective.
- **Add what you NEED not what you WANT**; This isn’t the main PA, if you have everything in the mix it gets pretty cluttered. This can muddy up the mix and keep the listener from hearing what they NEED to be able to play and sing with the rest of the group.
- **Use the ambient mic sparingly**; Many of the mixers have an onboard ambient mic. This can add great space to the mix, but it can also cause chaos.
- **Make the over all level as loud as you need, not just LOUD**; Remember that the ear-buds are only inches from the eardrum and this can cause hearing damage very fast.

A world class monitor mixer teaches this about mixing for musicians and singers. He uses the S. T. P. treatment.
- **Self** - They need to hear their own voice/ instrument.
- **Time** - They need to stay in time so they need to hear the snare/ hi-hat/ whatever is keeping time.
- **Pitch** - They need to stay on pitch so they will need the melody.

_Everything else is just ear candy._

#### Earphone Considerations (see above recommendations, the below is another person's opinion to consider)
You can have the best mixer and a well crafted mix but if you don’t have good monitors, it will all be for not. So lets talk earphones. I am going to split this up into three sections, and give you the pros and cons of each:
- **Generic headphones (e.g. Shure SE 215, Westone UM 10, UE 900S)**; If you are on stage once a month, or on a tight budget, these are for you. Entry level pricing is around $100 per set and you can replace the earpiece with cleaning for multiple users. Although the more expensive generics may have duel or even triple drivers, the affordable ones are usually single driver units. They are usually a bit more fragile, but the lower cost make replacing them less painful. And they
sound much better than iPod earphones or the drugstore brand that makes you look like a pirate.
- **Custom molded earphones (e.g. Ultimate Ears, 1964, etc.)**; If you use earphones every week or more, you really need to invest in custom molded earphones. While it is a larger investment, the benefits far out way the sacrifice. They are also better for your hearing and your physical ears. There is no generic that can beat the sound of a good quality set of custom molded IEMs. Prices range from $400 to $1800 plus getting your ears molded at an Audiologist. You can save that money with Ultimate Ears as they have patented a digital ear scanner. You can find more info on this here.
- **Cheap headphones**; DON’T USE THEM for this kind of monitoring. Just Say NO!

#### Final thoughts
- Not everyone should have a Personal Mixer.  You may want to think about mixing the BGV's from the sound console.
- Training, Training, Training.  You will have to train and train often. Have a quarterly training.
- Patience is key.  No matter how much you train, users will not remember everything. Be patient and know that is the norm
from now on.
- Know the mixer better than them.  You are and forever will be the expert. Live it, learn it, love it.

### General Guidelines for optimal worship / production / band / tech teaming
* It is understood that sometimes last minute decisions / changes have to be made, but these should be the exception and not the rule.  Set lists / service program contents, team members in worship or production should not change at the last minute whenever possible.  Changes are completely acceptable 2 weeks before the service, 1 week before the service is not ideal, with less than 1 week before the service a change should be rare.
* If there are 3 or less musicians (not vocalists) on stage, it is desired that multi-track sources and multi-track output hardware is used.  If only a loop and click/cue signal is provided, the worship leader must be able to remove the audio for the extra instruments.  In general the loop should contain fewer instruments and avoid extra percussion and synth audio (as these types of tracks tend to add "distortion" and sometimes "mud" to the mix).
* If production / tech is not consulted on the purchase of any gear by the church, we will do our best to support its use but are not responsible for the quality of the end result when it is used live.  Ultimately, we are volunteers and not professionals and need to balance many aspects of any technical decision and purchase (which may include, but is not limited to reliability, ease of use, quality, long term capabilities, and cost).
* Similarly to above, any new gear that is asked to be put in production without an appropriate amount of time (typically 2 to 4 weeks) to learn, setup, configure, understand, etc. will be incorporated at the risk of having a major failure in the production main paths (audio, lighting, CG).
* Any musician or vocalist that serves must have their own gear and capabilities to directly integrate with our environment.  We expect a single audio path per instrument or vocalist (except drums).  We expect musicians to come with spare equipment (such as guitars, strings, tuners, capos, picks, stands, cords/cables, drum sticks) and all musicians & vocalists to come with their own IEMs (ear buds).
* From a wireless perspective we will attempt to use any musician's or vocalist's wireless equipment; however, if there is interference generated from that equipment and/or we are unable to easily connect and integrate it into our setup, then we will not spend any time in trying to make it work.  Ideally, the musician should consult with the production team before bringing in new wireless equipment to insure compatibility.
* Our desire is to maintain a "silent stage" by using IEMs only (we will not provide wired or wireless stage monitors/amplified speakers as monitors).  Ideally, we would prefer to not have any instrument amplifier that is mic'ed.  If an amplifier is needed / required we can allow up to two and they must be reasonably small (not larger than 18" x 20" x 24").
* The production / tech members are to be considered at all times as co-laborers in worship / worship "leaders" ... collectively the band & tech teams work seamlessly together to enable a successful contemporary worship experience.
Musicians that are part of the Wellspring community are expected to arrive at the start of setup (currently 7am) in order to assist with stage setup, placement of major audio runs and cabling.  Drummers in particular must be able to completely set up the drum kit and shield.  The sound techs can assist with mic'ing the drum kit.  In general, all musicians must come early enough to insure that all personal gear is setup and ready for sound check at 8:30am.
